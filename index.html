                <h1>Anonymous Is Looking For A New Member</h1>
                <p>So you want to join Anonymous?
                    You can not join Anonymous. Nobody can join Anonymous.
                    Anonymous is not an organization. It is not a club, a party or even a movement. 
                    There is no charter, no manifest, no membership fees. Anonymous has no leaders, 
                    no gurus, no ideologists. In fact, it does not even have a fixed ideology.</p>
